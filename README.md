# Data Science Practice

This repository serves as my personal data science sandbox, filled with Jupyter Notebooks and datasets documenting my journey of learning and applying data science techniques. Feel free to explore.

## What You'll Find:

* **Notebooks:** Dive into various data science areas like data analysis, machine learning, and visualization through hands-on notebooks.
* **Data:** Discover the datasets used in the notebooks, with details on their sources and any ethical considerations relevant to their use.
* **Experiments:** Witness my ongoing attempts to tackle specific problems using data science tools, showcasing both successes and learning experiences.

## My Goal:

* Solidify my understanding of data science through practical exercise and experimentation.
* Share my learning journey and contribute to the data science community by making this repository open and  evolving as I progress in my data science path. Expect to see new notebooks, datasets, and experiments added regularly.
